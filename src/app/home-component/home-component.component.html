            Nature displays incredible diversity in all her glory. There are fat trees and skinny ones,
            short ones and tall ones. Within a single clump of yellow flowers, you might see a pink one
            and realize that it's a mutation. In nature, we don't say 'How wrong! That flower is different,
            that tree is fat!' Instead, we say, 'How beautiful!' This impacts us below the level of thought.

            Mysteries, unexplainable phenomena and spooky events never fail to catch the
            attention of people. Some of these events just lead to new discoveries while
            others turn into spine-chilling ghost stories. India, also known as the land
            of superstitions, has many uncanny stories of black magic, ghosts, spirits and
            unexplainable deaths to narrate.
